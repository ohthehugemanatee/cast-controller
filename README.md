# Cast lights controller

This script uses a presentation remote control to run The Cast's stage LED lights.

The lights themselves are controlled by [led-control](https://github.com/jackw01/led-control/), this script only sends HTTP signals to the API.

Call it using `python3 <path to cast-controller>.
